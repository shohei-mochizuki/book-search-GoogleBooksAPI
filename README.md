## INSTALLATION 
### HEROKU
If you access the application on [Heroku](https://book-search-googlebooksapi.herokuapp.com/), you can use the application on Heroku.

### LOCAL
This application requires 1.JavaScript, 2.Node.JS (version 16, not the latest), 3.Node package manager and 4.MongoDB. In a blank folder, put necessary files (refer to the [TESTS section](#tests) for the details) and open the command line. In the command line, move to this folder and then type "npm install". Make sure that a folder called "node_modules" and a file called package-lock.json are created in all the root, server and client folders. Then type "npm run develop" and the homepage will show up automatically.

## USAGE 
You will first land on About Me page. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, you can see buttons to move to another pages:
* About Me (my short introduction)
* Portfolio (my projects and works with links to deployed page and to GitHub repo)
* Contact (THIS IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
* Resume (my resume and skills)
